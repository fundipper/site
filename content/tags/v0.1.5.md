in the last version, when we use `site` command，we are only need clone the default content, because the default content include the default theme，but when we need update the default theme，we also need update the default content，it‘s a repeat action, we must have change.

now，we split `site` command to two step，first clone the default content，then clone the default theme，this will help us change the default theme quickly，and reduce the count of commit

## ADD

- [x] add create theme to create site command
