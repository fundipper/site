in the last version, we use `go install` in github workflows to install fungo environment, because all of the dependency libraries need network, that cost at least 40 seconds, is there some way to change it? 

of course, it's docker, with it we only need a start container, so we make an docker image named `fundipper/fungo`, and put it in github workflows, now the cost at most 15 second.

## ADD

- [x] add git to alpine
