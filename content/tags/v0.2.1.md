fungo use `fsnotify` to watch file change,in the last version, we have alreay add some dir, because fsnotify can only watch the first level, so if you have multiple levels of nested directories, fungo may be can't get your file change, you need restart fungo serve manual to watch theme.

now we add all of the file to `fsnotify`, whatever you change a markdown file, a templte file, a config file, a i18n file or a static file such as image, css, fungo will watch theme, and reload serve automatic.

## ADD

- [x] add route -> path, modify watch bugs
