fungo have many catalog in `article` model, someone are automatic generate such as archive, categray, tag and someone are manual generate such as the list of `article`.

in the last version, we use the same template named `catalog.html` to render all of the customize list of `article`, this is a big problem when you have more than one `article` dir and want to render them with different view.

now we have resolve it, you can set template paramer when add `article` model in the `config.toml`, then you can render the different dir to different view by yourself.

## ADD

- [x] add cusitomze catalog template
