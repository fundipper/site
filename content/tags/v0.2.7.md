when we write articles, documents by markdown or rich text editor, we always need to link to some wiki, blog, page or open source works, such like

```makdown
[fungo](http://github.com/fundipper/fungo)
```

but goldmark only parse it to `a` like this

```html
<p>
	<a href="http://github.com/fundipper/fungo">fungo</a>
</p>
```

we can't add any attributes, and it's usually bad for `SEO`, how to resolve it?

now, we have a solution named [goldmark-links](https://github.com/fundipper/goldmark-links), an extension of goldmark.

```toml
[site.markdown.link.source]
"fungo.dev" = true
"www.fundipper.cn" = true

[site.markdown.link.attribute]
rel = "nofollow"
target = "_blank"
```

for more info? see the [link](/doc/config/site/link/) document.
